Small python projects I've made over the past few years, in one collection. This will be a place for me to upload small python applets that are not useful in the slightest but I thought were fun. 

Heck, I may or may not add more little things as time goes along. Depends really.

Currently, this repository contains three projects, Circle, Colours and Hangman. These are all made using pygame.

# Circle

![Circle](/-images/circle.png)

**Circle** uses four configurable drawers to sketch out a wave. Each circle will produce its own sine wave, and the results are added and normalised to produce a compound wave as a dynamically generated graph. Run `main2.py`.

# Colours

![Colours](/-images/colours.png)

**Colours** is a very simple program which gives you three colour sliders, corresponding to red, green and blue. Dragging them along will dynamically change the background to that RGB value represented by the colours. Run `COLORS.pyw`.

# Hangman

![Hangman](/-images/hangman.png)

**Hangman** is what it says on the tin. One word is randomly generated from a list, and the player has to guess the correct word within a certain amount of guesses, else the man gets hanged! Run `hangman.pyw`
